# Start Here

Welcome to the React Developer interview. This coding exercise should take you no more than 4 hours, but you have 24 hours to complete from the moment you fork.

You'll be building a functional feature that gives users the ability to add fruits to their shopping cart. Your feature should fulfill the following requirements while ensuring production-ready code quality:

1. Query for the list of anime
2. The input should be a typeahead that renders anime names. When typing into the typeahead, the search results are fetched and displayed. There is NO "Submit" or "Search" button. Data should be fetched on input change.
3. Upon clicking on an anime, we should be directed to a page dedicated to that anime.
4. Feel free to make use a design of your choosing, but I expect a nice UI and UX when executing the search

The above requirements are the bare minimum. Below are some extra bonus points to consider, and elements I'll be looking out for as I review your code:

1. Make intuitive UI considerations, add comments if necessary to explain your decision thought process.
2. Make sure to implement performant code. In a real world scenario, consider how your implementation could be optimized.
3. Accessibility
4. General best practices around component structuring
5. You're allowed to use libraries for more complicated functionality, but bonus points if you implement everything yourself
